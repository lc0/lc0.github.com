Go or Golang is an open source programming language initially developed by Google.
First time I tried Go in 2009 or so, because I was interested in a very nice approach to synchronization based on channels.
And now, many years later, I'm back to this nice language, but now with completely different tasks and expectations.

So, because of my current position, I was interested in a bit different feature set, that usually you ask language for.
In that blog post I'm going to describe a couple of my use-cases of Go and how you could solve such task with a couple of tips and examples that
unfortunately aren't covered in documentations.

Also, this blog spot is kind of follow-up after the meetup of [Munich Gophers - Munich Golang User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Munich-Gophers-Go-User-Group/) organazied by me and Dominic on April 24, 2014.
Bellow you could find slides and video of the talk.
