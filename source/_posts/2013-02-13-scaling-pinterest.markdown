Interesting video from Surge 2012 conference by guys from Pinterest. Yash Nelapati and Marty Weiner tell the story
of changes of the startup's infrastructure from early days and when Pinterest became one of the biggest website.
Interesting to follow changes of technologies, especially withing such small group of engineers.
